{{% notice tip %}}
If you are just experimenting and playing around with Humio, you can probably
skip this page. **For production deployments you want to set up authentication, the first thing you do.**

If not configured otherwise Humio runs in `NO_AUTH` mode, meaning that there
are no access restrictions at all â€“ anyone with access to the system, can do
anything.


Refer to the [Authentication Configuration]({{< ref "configuration/authentication/_index.md" >}}) for different login options.
