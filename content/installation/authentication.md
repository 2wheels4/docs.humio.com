If not configured otherwise Humio runs in `NO_AUTH` mode, meaning that there
are no access restrictions at all â€“ anyone with access to the system, can do
anything.

If you are just experimenting and playing around with Humio, you can probably
just leave it as it is.

For any real deployment you want to change this the first thing you do.

Refer to the [Authentication Configuration]({{< ref "configuration/authentication/_index.md" >}}) for different login options.
