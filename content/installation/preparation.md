## Enable Authentication

{{% notice tip %}}
If you are just experimenting and playing around with Humio, you can probably
skip this page. **For production deployments you want to set up authentication.**
{{% /notice %}}

If authentication is not configured Humio runs in `NO_AUTH` mode, meaning that there
are no access restrictions at all â€“ anyone with access to the system, can do
anything.

Refer to the [Authentication Configuration]({{< ref "configuration/authentication/_index.md" >}}) for different login options.


## Increase Open File Limit

Humio needs to be able keep a lot of files open. The default limits
on unix systems are typically too low for any significant amount of data.

For Humio to perform you need to increase the limit.
You can do that by running:

```shell
cat << EOF | tee /etc/security/limits.d/99-humio-limits.conf
# Raise limits for files.
humio soft nofile 250000
humio hard nofile 250000
EOF

cat << EOF | tee -a /etc/pam.d/common-session
# Apply limits:
session required pam_limits.so
EOF
```

**These settings apply to the next login of the Humio user, not to any running processes.**
