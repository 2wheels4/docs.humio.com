At this time we recommend not running Humio inside a Kubernetes cluster. We are exploring approaches for deploying both standalone and clustered Humio environments on Kubertes and will provide best practices in the future.

## Community Resources
If you would like to experiment with running Humio on Kubernetes today you can reference a community based effort by Kasper Nissen of Lunar Way that utilizes Helm and Minikube. You can find his project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaspernissen/k8s-humio).
