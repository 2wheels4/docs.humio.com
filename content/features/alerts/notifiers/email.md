The e-mail notifier is our simplest notifier. It takes a list of e-mail addresses separated by a `,`.

The e-mail notifier will by default send out a nicely styled email with the most important aspects of an alarm, including a link back into Humio with the result.

Should you for some reason want to modify the e-mail you can do so by checking "Use custom email template" and fill out the "Message Body Template". See [Notifier templates](/features/alerts/notifiers/) for how to use our templates.
