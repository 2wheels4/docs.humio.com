Sending logs to Humio is most probably the most important part of any log management system and at Humio it's something
we rate *very* high.

In this section we will cover everything about how to send your logs to Humio. The section is divided into
[integrations]({{< relref "integrations/_index.md" >}}), which a great starting point if an integration for your platform is
offered, and [data shippers]({{< relref "log_shippers/_index.md" >}}), which should cover all other use cases.

It's very important you understand how the [parsers]({{< relref "parsers/_index.md" >}}) and
[ingest tokens]({{< relref "ingest_tokens.md" >}}) work.

Finally, we have a section about how our [Ingest API]({{< relref "ingest-api.md" >}}) works.
