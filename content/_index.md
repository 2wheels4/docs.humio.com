# Documentation Overview

Humio is a fast and flexible logging platform. It is available for self-hosting or as SaaS.
Humio is compatible with most popular open-source data shippers (Fluentd, Rsyslog, FileBeat, etc.)
so it is easy to adopt or migrate to from other platforms like ElasticSearch ELK.
The simple yet powerful query language feels familiar to most developers,
and works on any data format - structured or unstructured.

Humio keeps the cost of data ingestion low, and uses heavy compression for data at rest.
This allows you to _log and keep everything_ for optimal observability, without punishing you
for data spikes or having growing data volumes.

The REST API and snappy graphical user interface allows you to search, transform and observe
events as they occur â€“ in Real-Time. And when we say real-time, we mean sub-second delays
from data arriving for ingestion before it is displayed on a live dashboard.

Finally, built-in support for alerting and integrations with popular operations platforms (like
PageDuty, OpsGene or VictorOps) means Humio can be the backbone of your operations infrastructure,
a power tool for your help-desk teams and your trusted navigator on an ocean of data.
