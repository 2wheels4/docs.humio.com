# Humio documentation
<!--img style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;" src="./images/humio-owl.svg"-->

Welcome to the documentation pages for Humio.

We have divided the documentation into a number of sections

If you are new to log management take a look at our [Getting started](/getting_started/) section which will help you understand what log management and Humio is, as well as how you can easily [migrate from the Elastic Stack](/getting_started/moving_from_elastic_stack/) to Humio.

The second section, [Sending logs to Humio](/sending_logs_to_humio/) is all about how you can send your data to Humio. We've gone ahead and compiled a list of most common ways of forwarding logs right here
