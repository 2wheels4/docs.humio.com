[Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) is a framework
for connecting Kafka with other systems such as Humio. If you have your data
in Kafka consider this approach for sending data to Humio.  We have worked with
Confluent, achieved Gold Verification, and are now able to offer our new Kafka Connector which uses our
fast and efficient HEC endpoint!  You can get started by visiting the [Confluent Hub page](https://www.confluent.io/hub/humio/kafka-connect-hec-sink) or
or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/humio/kafka-connect-hec-sink).
