The [Elastic Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) are a
great group of data shippers. They are cross-platform, lightweight, and can ship data to a number of tools **including Humio**.

All Beats are built using the [libbeat library](https://github.com/elastic/beats). Along with the official Beats, there are a growing number of
[community Beats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/community-beats.html).


## Available Beats

There are currently five official Beats. The Elastic documentation site and Humio's documentation offer resources that describe how to use each of them:

* **[Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html)** - Ships regular log files.
    * [Get Started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-getting-started.html)

***Community Beats***
In addition, the Elastic community has created many other Beats that you can download and use.  
These [Community Beats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/community-beats.html) cover many less common use cases.

## General Output Configuration

All beats are built using the [libbeat library](https://github.com/elastic/beats) and
share output configuration.  Humio supports parts of the ElasticSearch
ingest API, so to send data from Beats to Humio, you just use the
[ElasticSearch output](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/elasticsearch-output.html)
(the documentation is identical for all Beats).

You can use the following `elasticsearch` output configuration template:

``` yaml
output:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://$HOST:443/api/v1/dataspaces/$REPOSITORY_NAME/ingest/elasticsearch"]
    username: $INGEST_TOKEN
```

{{< partial "common-rest-params" >}}

{{% notice note %}}
To optimize performance for the data volumes you want to send, and to keep shipping latency down, change the default settings for `compression_level`, `bulk_max_size` and `flush_interval`.

## Adding fields

All Beats also have a `fields` section in their configuration. You can add fields to all events by specifying them in the `fields` section:

``` yaml
fields:
    service: user-service
    datacenter: dc-a
```
