NodeJS library [humio-node](https://github.com/humio/humio-node/) is a simple
client that allows you to send data to Humio and run query and aggregations.

Currently _humio-node_ is not able to run in the browser.
If you are looking for a browser integration check out [humio.js]({{< ref "browser-javascript.md" >}}).
