title: syslog-utc
aliases: ["/parsers/built-in-parsers/syslog-utc"]
---

This parser can process standard lines generated by the `syslog` system.

The parser expects lines to starts with a timestamp, followed by the optional fields `host` `app` `pid`
It also expects the timestamp to be in the UTC time zone.

Often syslog timestamps are in local time. If that is the case, then copy this parser and specify the time zone.
This parser also leverages Humio's built-in [key-value parser]({{< relref "#kv" >}}).

## Example Input
