# Sending logs to Humio

Sending logs to Humio is most probably the most important part of any log management system and at Humio it's something
we rate *very* high.

In this section we will cover everything about how to send your logs to Humio. The section is divided into
[integrations](/sending_logs_to_humio/integrations/), which a great starting point if an integration for your platform is
offered, and [log shippers](/sending_logs_to_humio/log_shippers/), which should cover all other use cases.

It's very important you understand how the [parsers](/sending_logs_to_humio/parsers/) and
[ingest tokens](/sending_logs_to_humio/ingest_tokens) work.

Finally, we have a section about how our [Humio HTTP API](/sending_logs_to_humio/transport/http_api/) works.
