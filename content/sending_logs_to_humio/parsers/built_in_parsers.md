title: "Built in parsers"
---

Humio supplies built-in parsers for common log formats. For example, it includes a parser for the widely-used [accesslog](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog) format for web servers like Apache and Nginx.

This page lists and describes each of the built-in parsers.

When shipping data to Humio, check if there is a built-in parser for the logs before writing a custom parser.
The built-in parsers are also a good starting point when creating custom parsers.

***About Parsers***

See the [Parsing logs](/sending_logs_to_humio/parsers/parsing/) page for an overview of how parsers work.

You can try out each of the built-in parsers directly in the Humio interface.

To try a parser, open its page and check the supported regular expression and timestamp formats. When you paste in test data, Humio shows the result of parsing.

## accesslog
This parser can handle the `accesslog` format. This format is the default log format used by Apache and Nginx.

The parser also supports putting the response time at the end of the log line.
If you have modified the logging of your web server, then copy the built-in accesslog parser and modify it to suit your customizations.

***Examples of the `accesslog` format***

```
localhost - - [25/Feb/2017:21:05:16 +0100] "POST /api/v1/dataspaces/dataspace/ingest/elasticsearch/_bulk HTTP/1.1" 200 50 "-" "Go-http-client/1.1" 0.000 848`

## syslog-utc
This parser can process standard lines generated by the `syslog` system.

The parser expects lines to starts with a timestamp, followed by the optional fields `host` `app` `pid`
It also expects the timestamp to be in the UTC time zone.

Often syslog timestamps are in local time. If that is the case, then copy this parser and specify the time zone.
This parser also leverages Humio's built-in [key-value parser](/sending_logs_to_humio/parsers/parsing/#Key-value-parsing).

***Examples of the `syslog` format***

```
Feb 25 19:17:01 Myhost CRON[24886]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)
Feb 25 06:35:01 Myhost CRON[24272]: (root) CMD (command -v deb-sa1 > /dev/null && deb-sa1 1 1)
```

## kv
This parser is the key-value parser. It can process standard key-value patterns in log lines.

This parser uses Humio's built-in [key-value parser](/sending_logs_to_humio/parsers/parsing/#Key-value-parsing).
It expects the log line to start with a date in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formatting.

The parser processes the rest of the line for key-value pairs.

***Example of key-value parsing***

```
2017-02-25T20:18:43.598+0000 created a new user user="John Doe" service=user-service as a freemium user
```

Given the above log line, Humio parses the fields `user=John Doe` and `service=user-service`.

## kv-millis
This parser, like the [kv parser](/sending_logs_to_humio/parsers/built_in_parsers/#kv-millis) parser, is a key-value parser. However, it expects the timestamp in the log line to be UTC time in milliseconds.

{{% notice note %}}
***Example of key-value parsing with millisecond timing***

```
1488054417000 created a new user user="John Doe" service=user-service as a freemium user
```

Given the above log line, Humio parses the fields `user=John Doe` and `service=user-service`.

## json
This parser can process JSON data in log lines.

It expects to find the timestamp in a field named '@timestamp'.
The timestamp must be in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

{{% notice note %}}
***Example of a JSON log line***
``` json
{
  "@timestamp": "2017-02-25T20:18:43.598+00:00",
  "loglevel": "INFO",
  "service": {
	"name": "user service",
	"time": 123
  }
}
```

## bro-json
This parser can process JSON data generated from [Bro](https://www.bro.org/).  
We have documentation [here](/walkthroughs/bro/) describing how to send Bro data to Humio.
This parser is tailored to handle the output generated from the Bro script in the linked to documentation.    
The name of the Bro log file will become a `#path` tag in Humio.

## corelight-json
Built in parser that supports [Corelights](https://www.corelight.com/) Bro sensors.

Corelight sensors have out of the box support for streaming out the Bro logs. Humio can receive the streaming data using this parser and [ingest listeners](/operation/on_prem_http_api/#adding-a-ingest-listener-endpoint).
