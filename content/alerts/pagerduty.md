Humio supports Pagerduty alerts through our Notifier system.

To create a PagerDuty Notifier you need to create a "Service"
in your PagerDuty Account (Note that you have to be an admin in PagerDuty).

In PagerDuty you can do that by going to:

`Configuration` __→__ `Services` → `Add New Service`.

For the Integration Type make sure you "Use our API directly" and select
Event API v2" in the drop down.

Just follow the instructions for there, and when you are done, copy the Integration Key here.
