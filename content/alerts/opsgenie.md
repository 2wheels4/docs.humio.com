OpsGenie is an Alert Routing & Incident Management system that works very well
with Humio.

With an OpsGenie account set up you can:

1. Go to [Add Humio integration](https://app.opsgenie.com/integration#/add/Humio)
1. Give it a name
1. Copy the API Key
1. Save the integration

In Humio, you just need to create a new notifier on the Notifiers page by
hitting the New Notifier button.

When having selected the OpsGenie from the Notifier Type dropdown you just need
to give it a name and paste the API Key into the OpsGenie API Key field and
hit save.
