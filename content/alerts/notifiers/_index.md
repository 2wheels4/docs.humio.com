The list of alert notifiers are ever growing and we currently support the following systems
{{%children%}}


## Message Templates {#templates}

Notifier templates are used to create the message sent by notifiers.
They currently apply to [Email](email.md) and [WebHook](webhook.md) notifiers.
The template engine is a simple "search/replace" model, where the `{â€¦}` marked
placeholders are replaced with contextual aware variables.

See the list for an explanation of the placeholders:

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
