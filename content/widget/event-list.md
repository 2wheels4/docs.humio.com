The _Event List_ widget is meant to display events as their roll into Humio. It
is the detail widget type on the search page for non-aggregated data e.i. events.
It is best used with pure filter queries and {{< function "tail" >}}.

## Input Format

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                                                                     |
|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@id`         | string   | I meta field automatically generated by Humio for all events.                                                   |
| `@timestamp`  | datetime | The timestamp of the events is used to order events in the list.                                                |
| `@rawstring`  | string   | The content of the line. Usually this value is automatically assigned during parsing.                           |
| `@display`    | string   | OPTIONAL. If present on an event this value is used as content of the list item, instead of `@rawstring`        |

## Usage

The event list is the main way of exploring event in Humio. By selecting items in
the list you can inspect all fields of the event in the inspection panel.
The inspection panel contains buttons to quickly drill down the data.

The event list will as many results as returned by the Humio server which defaults
to the `200` most recent events of the search interval. You can increase this
my using the {{< function "tail" >}} function, e.g. {{< code "tail(1000)" >}},
but this can cause performance issues in the UI if too elements have to be rendered.  

### Keyboard Navigation

You can use the keyboard to navigate the event. `alt-ctrl-down` and `alt-ctrl-up`
will move the selection up and down the list, while displaying the fields in the
inspection panel.
