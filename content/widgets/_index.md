Widgets are the UI elements that make up dashboard. The most common widget is one that visualizes
search results using charts, lists, and tables.

[Note Widgets]({{< ref "note-widget.md" >}}) can contain usage descriptions, 
user guides and dynamic links to other systems. 

This section introduces each widget and give examples of queries that could
be used along with them.

The widget that is used most frequently is the [Time Chart Widget]({{< ref "time-chart.md" >}})
and working with time charts is a good skill to master when working with Humio.
