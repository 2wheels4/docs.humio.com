Widgets are the UI elements that visualize query results. E.g. you can show
results as a table or time chart.

This section introduces each widget and give examples of queries that could
be used along with them.

The widget that is used most frequently is the [Time Chart Widget]({{< ref "time-chart.md" >}})
and working with time charts is a good skill to master when working with Humio.
