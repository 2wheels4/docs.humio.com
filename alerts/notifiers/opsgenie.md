OpsGenie is an Alert Routing & Incident Management system that works very well with Humio.
With a OpsGenie account set up, you can then go to [Add Humio integration](https://app.opsgenie.com/integration#/add/Humio), give it a name, copy the API Key, and save the integration.  
In Humio, you just need to create a new notifier on the Notifiers page by hitting the New Notifier button.
When having selected the OpsGenie from the Notifier Type dropdown, you just need to give it a name and paste the API Key into the OpsGenie API Key field, and hit save.
