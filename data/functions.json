The computation assumes periodic data set (the period parameter specifies the  length of the period), such as daily or weekly traffic measurements.  The function works best when the timechart's span (with of each bucket) is a multiple of the period, as the smoothing is done in  units of the buckets. \n\n  For example, a 30 day chart with a 7 day period would have 4 periods from day 2 to 30 (the first 2 days being ignored). Based on this, the first 3 periods (in this case period 1, 2 and 3) are fed into the smoothing/forecast computation, producing a \"forecast\" for the fourth period.  Smoothing data for period 2, 3 and 4 are emitted, the last period being entirely computed.
